A pretty neat browser-based drawing toy based on the Etch-A-Sketch ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) · [Official Website](https://www.spinmaster.com/en-US/brands/etch-a-sketch/)), originally created as a practice on Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation through JavaScript.

This project was created as the [fourth practice project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) during my journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), the [first](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes), [second](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), and [third](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#introduction) being _[Recipes](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/odin-recipes)_, _[Landing Page](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/landing-page)_, and _[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/ali-aboulsauood/rock-paper-scissors)_, respectively.

## About Etch-A-Sketch

### Brief History of the Etch-A-Sketch

_This section was adapted from the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), mostly from the articles on [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) and [Lineography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineography)._

The _Etch-A-Sketch_ is a mechanical drawing toy invented by the French toymaker [André Cassagnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Cassagnes) and subsequently manufactured by the [Ohio Art Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Art_Company) from 1960 to 2016, when it became owned by the [Spin Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_Master) of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The Etch-A-Sketch has a thick, flat gray screen enclosed within a red plastic frame, which has two white knobs on its front and in its lower corners - twisting the knobs moves a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, leaving a solid line, where the left and right knobs move the stylus horizontally and vertically, respectively, allowing for the creation of [lineographic images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineography) - images drawn without lifting the drawing device being used.

The practice of lineography was born in France in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and became disused by the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, until it was reborn again in the 1960s - with the release of the Etch-A-Sketch, which was used to reproduce some famous works of art, such as the [Mona Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa). The Etch-A-Sketch became one of the best known toys of that era.

This electronic version of Etch-A-Sketch is designed to have some resemblance to the original machine, allowing for the creation of lineographic images, by hovering over a square grid of adjustable resolution (total number of squares, or _grid size_).

### Features

**NOTE**: _This project is **still in development**. This section will be updated each time a new feature is added/updated/removed_.

Currently, The features of _Etch-A-Sketch_ shall be expected to be limited to the requirements described in the [project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#assignment), including those described in the ["_Extra Credit_" section](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#extra-credit).

More features may be added later.
